## 0-memset.c
- Fills memory with a constant byte.
- Fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant
byte b, and then returns a pointer to s (functions similarly to memset).
## 1-memcpy.c
- Copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest.
- Returns a pointer to dest.
- src and dest memory areas must not overlap or it might cause undesired
behaviour.
## 2-strchr.c
- Locates a character in a string.
- Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s,
or NULL if the character is not found
